##Intelligent-Wine-Quality-Prediction##

**Overview**

The Intelligent Wine Quality Prediction platform uses Machine Learning to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties. It provides insights into factors affecting wine quality and supports data-driven decisions for winemakers and enthusiasts. The project combines data visualization, classification models, and performance evaluation to deliver accurate predictions.

Key Features

Wine Quality Classification: Predicts wine quality as high or low based on chemical properties.

Multiple ML Models: Implements Decision Tree Classifier and Logistic Regression for comparison.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uses Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize correlations, distributions, and patterns.

Performance Evaluation: Evaluates models using ROC curves, AUC scores, and classification metrics.

Efficient Data Handling: Applies Python loops and logic for automation and preprocessing.

Problem Statement

Predicting wine quality is challenging due to complex chemical interactions. Common problems include:
